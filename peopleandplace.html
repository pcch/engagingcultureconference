				<h1>People</h1>
				<p>Each year the conference is molded in large part around the people who graciously give of their time, experience, and expertise to speak, facilitate discussions, and provide opportunities for design, creativity, and hands-on projects.</p>

				<p>This year we are blessed to have some amazing people who are living out (in various and creative ways) what this whole conference is about.</p> 

				<p><img src="images/JoeBoyd.jpg" alt="JoeBoyd" width="240" height="159" style="float:left;" />Our Keynote Speaker this year is Joe Boyd. Joe graduated from Cincinnati Christian University and spent several years leading a successful youth adult church in Las Vegas before pursuing a career in the entertainment industry. A student of comedy improv, Joe went on to act in live stage shows, commercials and soap operas while writing his own screenplays. Years later he returned to vocational ministry as the teaching pastor of The Vineyard in Cincinnati. Aside from teaching, Joe also runs Rebel Pilgrim Productions, which has produced several feature length films. The films have received strong reviews and notable awards within the Indie film scene. Joe is currently wrapping up his latest film called "A Strange Kind of Happy" starring Christian recording artist, Rebecca St. James, and Academy Award-winning actress, Shirley Jones. Joe also published his first fiction novel "Between Two Kingdoms" and has blogged for nearly 10 years.</p>
