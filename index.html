				<h1>About Engaging Culture</h1>
				<p>There are many elements of society that have become inverted from God's original plan and intention for culture.  This has produced despair and apathy, confusion and disparity, paralysis and idolatry.</p>

				<p>The purpose of Engaging Culture is to pinpoint some of these areas; deepen our understanding of the complex issues; discuss, design, and react to that information; and then sustain the engagement when we return to our homes and universities.</p>

				<p>The bulk of the weekend will revolve around three deliberate grids that dive into the core of culture.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="grids.html" class="bolden">Engaging Urban Culture</a> will discuss the causes and effects of poverty and racism in the inner-city and possible responses and solutions to those problems.</li>
					<li><a href="grids.html" class="bolden">Engaging Global Culture</a> will give a broad view of issues and challenges that Jesus followers are being called to meet in our world with a specific focus on ministry to Muslims and immigrants.</li>
					<li><a href="grids.html" class="bolden">Engaging Pop Culture</a> will explore the subtleties of how the arts, media, and public policy shape and distort our world view and discuss the art of living out the Gospel contextually.</li>
				</ul>
